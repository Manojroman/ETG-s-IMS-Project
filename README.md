# ETG-s-IMS-Project
This repository was created in order to submit the project about IMS(Inventory Management System) to Elite Techno Group's Skill India python ML/AI Internship.


I have created this project on my own without any third party's help

        - At first I have written a code to create a json file for products to access eith some initial values.
        
        - Then second part accessing the json file,In this i have added multiple feature
          to interact with the user in a proper manner. on executing the second you can do
          your shopping activity with the interface I have created with python script.
         
        -Also in the part the changes made by the user by accessing the file are also stored
         in different format of file like( csv , txt , json ).
