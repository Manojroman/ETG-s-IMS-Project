# ETG-s-IMS-Project
This repository was created in order to submit the project about IMS(Inventory Management System) to Elite Techno Group's Skill India python ML/AI Internship.


I have created this project on my own without any third party's help

In this project:
In the Inventory management project.ipynb:
        - At first I have written a code to create a json file for products to access eith some initial values.
        
        - Then second part accessing the json file,In this i have added multiple feature to interact with the user in a proper manner.
          on executing the second you can do your shopping activity with the interface i have created with python script,
         
        -Also in the part the changes made by the user by accessing the file are also stored in different format of file like( csv , txt , json )
        
        -THen in final part the user can view hages made and the data stored in various format by executing all codes in final part
